# AlgorithmicTrading
The steps are divided into the following sections:

* Establish a Baseline Performance

* Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

* Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

* Create an Evaluation Report

#### Establish a Baseline Performance

1. How was the performance?
The performance was not good

#### Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

1. What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
Tuning the algorithm helped performance over the long term.

2. What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?
Having a short and long SMA window helped the performance. 

#### Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier

1. Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model?
The new model did not perform well over the time period.

2. Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?
 This model outperformed initially, then it suffered severe losses. 
 
 #### Evaluation Report
 
sThe Decision Tree Classifier showed some good performance early on. It would be interesting to slice the time period that didn't work out so well the try and understand what went wrong. As with any algorithmic trading program, there will need to be fine tuning along the way and introductions to various market enviornments.
